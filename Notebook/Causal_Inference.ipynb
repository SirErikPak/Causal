    "## Theoretical heart of causal inference\n",
    "**1. What Is a Causal Graph?**\n",
    "- A Causal Graph (or Directed Acyclic Graph, DAG) is a visual and mathematical representation of causal relationships between variables.\n",
    "- Nodes (V): Variables in your system (e.g., Smoking, Cancer).\n",
    "- Directed Edges (→): Causal effects (e.g., Smoking → Cancer).\n",
    "- Acyclic: No feedback loops (no circular causation).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Smoking ───▶ Tar buildup ───▶ Lung Cancer <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└──────────────▶ Lung Cancer\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram encodes causal structure, not just correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. From Correlation to Causation**\n",
    "- Traditional statistics estimates 𝑃(𝑌∣𝑋)\n",
    "P(Y∣X): “Given that we observe X, what’s Y?”\n",
    "- Causal inference wants 𝑃(𝑌∣𝑑𝑜(𝑋))\n",
    "P(Y∣do(X)): “If we force X to a value, what’s Y?”\n",
    "\n",
    "That do(X) operator is crucial — it represents intervention, not observation.\n",
    "The goal of causal analysis is to express 𝑃(𝑌∣𝑑𝑜(𝑋))\n",
    "P(Y∣do(X)) in terms of observable quantities (plain probabilities) whenever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. The do-Operator**\n",
    "- The do-operator, introduced by Judea Pearl, expresses interventions:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y∣do(X=x))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "- means: “Set X to x externally (like a randomized experiment) and observe the resulting distribution of Y.”\n",
    "- Mathematically, this means `removing all incoming edges into X` in the causal graph (since we’ve broken the natural causes of X).\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Backdoor Paths and Confounding**\n",
    "- A `backdoor path` is a non-causal path from X to Y that starts with an arrow into X — usually through a confounder. <br>\n",
    "U (genetics) <br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ↙ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ↘ <br>\n",
    "X (smoking) → Y (cancer)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, U is a confounder because it affects both X and Y.\n",
    "To estimate 𝑃(𝑌∣𝑑𝑜(𝑋))\n",
    "P(Y∣do(X)), you must “block” that backdoor path by `conditioning on U`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backdoor Criterion**\n",
    "A set of variables Z satisfies the backdoor criterion if:\n",
    "- Z blocks every backdoor path between X and Y, and\n",
    "- Z does not include descendants of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y∣do(X))= \\sum_z P(Y|X,Z)P(Z)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is the backdoor adjustment formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. The Three Rules of Do-Calculus**\n",
    "- Do-calculus provides a `formal algebra` for manipulating expressions involving do().\n",
    "It defines when interventions can be replaced with observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule 1 — Insertion/deletion of observations**<br>\n",
    "If Y ⫫ Z | X, W in the graph where edges into X are removed,<br>\n",
    "then:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y∣do(X),Z,W)=P(Y∣do(X),W)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Interpretation: If Z gives no new info about Y after conditioning on X and W, drop Z.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule 2 — Action/observation exchange**<br>\n",
    "If Y ⫫ Z | X, W in the graph where edges out of Z are removed,<br>\n",
    "then:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y∣do(X),do(Z),W)=P(Y∣do(X),Z,W)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Interpretation: If Z’s effect on Y is blocked by X and W, treat Z as observed instead of intervened.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule 3 — Insertion/deletion of actions**<br>\n",
    "If Y ⫫ Z | X, W in the graph where edges into X and out of Z are removed, <br>\n",
    "then:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y∣do(X),do(Z),W)=P(Y∣do(X),W)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Interpretation: If intervening on Z doesn’t affect Y given X and W, drop that intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Putting It Together — Identification**<br>\n",
    "The `goal of causal identification` is to express 𝑃(𝑌∣𝑑𝑜(𝑋)) entirely in terms of observable probabilities <br>\n",
    "P(Y∣X,Z) and 𝑃(𝑍)P(Z). <br>\n",
    "If we can do that, the effect is `identifiable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (Backdoor Adjustment): <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "X ← Z → Y\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, Z is a confounder. <br>\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y∣do(X))=\\sum_z P(Y∣X,z)P(z)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Frontdoor Adjustment**<br>\n",
    "When you can’t block confounding directly, sometimes an `intermediate mediator` helps: <br>\n",
    "X → M → Y <br>\n",
    "↑ <br>\n",
    "U → Y <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If:\n",
    "- M intercepts all directed paths from X to Y, and\n",
    "- U doesn’t directly affect M,\n",
    "\n",
    "then:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y∣do(X))=\\sum_m P(M∣X) \\sum_{x'} P(Y∣M,X')P(X')\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is the `frontdoor` adjustment."
