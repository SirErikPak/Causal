    "# A/B Testing\n",
    "A/B testing is a controlled experiment that compares two versions (A and B) to determine which performs better on a chosen metric, such as conversion rate, click-through rate, or revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key Points of A/B Testing:\n",
    "    - Random assignment: Users or subjects are randomly split into two groups to test variant A versus variant B.\n",
    "    - Hypotheses:\n",
    "        -  Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): There is no difference between A and B.\n",
    "        -  Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$): There is a difference (e.g., B performs better than A).\n",
    "    - Data collection: Collect data on user interaction with each variant.\n",
    "    - Statistical analysis: Use hypothesis testing (t-tests, z-tests, or nonparametric tests) to determine if observed differences are statistically significant.\n",
    "    - Decision making: If the null hypothesis is rejected with sufficient evidence, conclude that one variant is superior; otherwise, no difference is confirmed.\n",
    "- Practical Steps:\n",
    "    - Formulate hypotheses.\n",
    "    - Randomly assign users to groups.\n",
    "    - Run the experiment, collecting relevant metrics.\n",
    "    - Perform statistical tests to check for significant differences.\n",
    "    - Implement the winning variant based on results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B testing is widely used in product development, marketing, and UX research to optimize user engagement and business outcomes by data-driven decision-making. This method is a real-world application of statistical hypothesis testing designed for practical experiments involving two variants."

    "#### 1. Understand the Experiment Design\n",
    "- Clarify the goal: Increase conversion rate (the number of users who pay for the product).\n",
    "- Identify groups: “Control” (old page) vs. “Treatment” (new page).\n",
    "- Know your metrics: Focus on conversion rate, but also review related metrics like average order value or bounce rate for context.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Load and Explore the Data\n",
    "- Import all relevant data files (typically user-level logs or summaries of visits, conversions, variant assignments, etc.).\n",
    "- Use .head(), .info(), and basic plots (hist(), value_counts()) to get a sense for data shape, missingness, and distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Check Data Integrity\n",
    "- Ensure randomization: Each user should be assigned to only one group.\n",
    "- Check for duplicates and missing values.\n",
    "- Validate that test groups are balanced in size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Define Success Criteria\n",
    "- Decide on the statistical significance threshold ($\\alpha$ is standard).\n",
    "- Set the minimum detectable effect (MDE) your business cares about.\n",
    "- Clarify sample size requirements for adequate statistical power.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- Visualize conversion rates in control vs. treatment groups.\n",
    "- Plot histograms or boxplots for order value and other key metrics.\n",
    "- Summarize basic statistics: mean, median, counts, proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Statistical Testing\n",
    "- Calculate the observed difference in conversion rates.\n",
    "- Use appropriate hypothesis tests (e.g., z-test for proportions, t-test if comparing means) to assess significance.\n",
    "- Consider permutation tests if assumptions for parametric tests are questionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Interpret Results\n",
    "- Compare $\\rho-value$ to the $\\alpha$ threshold.\n",
    "- If significant: consider business and practical impact.\n",
    "- If not significant: review sample size and power—consider whether to extend testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. Additional Testing and Validation Steps\n",
    "- Common Additional Testing and Validation Steps:\n",
    "    - Permutation (Randomization) Tests: Directly estimate the null distribution of your test statistic by permuting group labels. Confirms robustness if assumptions of traditional parametric tests (like normality) are questionable.\n",
    "    - Bootstrap Confidence Intervals: Resample your observed data to estimate more robust confidence intervals for differences in conversion rate or other metrics.\n",
    "    - Subgroup Analysis: Check if effects are consistent across different customer segments (e.g., geography, device type, user tenure) to rule out confounding or strange heterogeneity.\n",
    "    - Test for Balance: Re-validate that the treatment and control groups are similar in covariates prior to treatment—imbalance could invalidate causal inference.\n",
    "    - Holdout Validation or Split-Test Replication: Run a smaller version of the experiment (or leave out a random subset as a “holdout” group) to check if effects replicate.\n",
    "    - Power Analysis Post-Hoc: Calculate the observed power of your test to help interpret non-significant results—is the test underpowered, or is there truly no effect?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If your main A/B z-test yields a p-value just above 0.05, running a permutation test and bootstrap interval can confirm whether this result is robust or might vary with sampling noise. Subgroup analysis may reveal that the treatment only helps a specific user group—affecting your rollout decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. Make and Justify Recommendation\n",
    "- Based on the statistical and practical analysis, advise whether to:\n",
    "    - Roll out the new page,\n",
    "    - Keep the old page,\n",
    "    - Or continue/adjust the experiment. "

    "    - Fail to reject the null hypothesis (i.e., not statistically significant) since the difference seen could easily be explained by random chance.\n",

    "    - This interval contains 0, meaning the true difference might be negative, positive, or zero.\n",

    "The proportion z-test and the chi-square test for two categories are mathematically equivalent in testing differences between two proportions for binary outcomes. The key points on - - when to use each are:\n",
    "    - The proportion z-test is typically used when you want a direct test comparing two proportions and can leverage the normal approximation. It explicitly computes a z-statistic and is conceptually more straightforward when dealing with exactly two categories. It is appropriate when sample sizes are large enough for the normal approximation.\n",
    "    - The chi-square test (with 1 degree of freedom) tests the same hypothesis via a contingency table and evaluates the association between two categorical variables. The chi-square statistic is the square of the z-statistic from the proportion z-test, and either test yields the same p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Historically, the z-test was preferred for two-category cases due to a more straightforward lookup of critical values, but this distinction is now mostly academic given modern computing.\n",
    "    - Use the proportion z-test if you want a straightforward difference in proportions test with normal theory. Use the chi-square test if you prefer the contingency table framework or are dealing with more categories.\n",
    "    - Both tests require sufficiently large samples (expected counts usually ≥5) to ensure the chi-square approximation and normal approximation hold.\n",
    "\n",
